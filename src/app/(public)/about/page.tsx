            <p>
                Investt was created to solve a simple problem:
                people are expected to make financial decisions
                without ever being taught how markets actually work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our goal is to make financial learning practical,
                ethical, and accessible — especially for students
                and first-time learners.
            </p>
